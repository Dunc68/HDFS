CHAPTER I - START IN LIFE



 I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,
 though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen,
 who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise,
 and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he
 had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very
 good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson
 Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we
 are now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe;
 and so my companions always called me.

 I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an
 English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the
 famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
 against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never
 knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.
